      "comment_1": "I have been taking Solle Naturals products for 5 ½ years. It’s really a challenge to put all the goodness of the products in a quick review, because there are so many benefits. Everything is better for me….from better digestion, better mood, more energy, calmer mind, better response to stress, just to name a few. I can honestly say that I would never want to be without Solle Naturals products.",
      "comment_2": "Solle products have given me my life back. Before Solle Naturals was part of my health journey I was exhausted and anxious all the time. My digestion was completely messed up and stress levels were an all time high. Now I can manage stress and oncoming panic attacks with ease, I have energy to conquer all of my tasks and I don’t suffer from daily anxiety.",
      "comment_3": "Solle Naturals have helped me in so many ways.. I no longer need a cup of coffee to wake up or a glass of wine to fall asleep..I worry less and accomplish more..my hair and nails and stronger and longer my hormones are now in balance. I am happier and healthier because of making these small changes.",
      "comment_4": "I am a busy mom of 3 kids and of course deal with weight gain, lack of energy, intermittent sleep patterns, stress, you name it as a mom. However, I’d been lacking in caring for myself. Since beginning Solle, I no longer crave coffee and have supplemented it for my coffee. I also find myself having more energy without a 3pm crash. All the way around I’ve been quite pleased with what I’ve tried.",
      "comment_5": "With Solle, I have more energy, less pain, and a handle on anxiety/stress...a must for helping me get through stressful days."
